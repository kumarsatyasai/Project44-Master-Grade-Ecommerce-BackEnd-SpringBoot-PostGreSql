    /*How to Decide
    ================
    There is no strict rule dictating which entity should be the owning side, but you can decide based on:
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Business Logic:
    ----------------
    Choose the side that makes more sense to control the relationship based on the domain model.
    For example, in a Student and Course relationship, you might decide that Student owns the relationship if students enroll in courses.
    Usage Patterns:
    ---------------
    If one side is more frequently used to manage the relationship (e.g., adding/removing entries in the join table), make that the owning side.
    Ex: User is More Frequently used for adding, removing entries in join table so user is Owing Side In this Context.
    Convention:
    -----------
    If thereâ€™s no clear preference, you can arbitrarily choose one side, but be consistent across your application.*/

    // Owning Side : Relation Ship Use @JoinTable, {cascade, Fetch at @MantToMany annotation}
    // Inverse Side : use mappedBy and cascade and fetch at @ManyToMany.

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "user_id")
    private User user;
}
